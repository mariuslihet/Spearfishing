Pre-requisites: a running chat server and hubot - optional but if you don't have them, replace the calls to the hubot to something else that informs you of the particular event.

also - the scripts that create pretexts are usually called from the hubot, so the output the python scripts give you about usage would be incorrect.

In your hubot, make sure to have the shell-command plugin.
